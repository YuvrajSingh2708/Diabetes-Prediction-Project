# Diabetes Prediction Project

## Introduction
This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in female individuals of Pima Indian heritage aged at least 21 based on diagnostic measurements. The dataset originates from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and includes key variables such as pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age.

## Project Overview
